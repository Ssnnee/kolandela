# Kolandéla

Kolandéla is an application for managing and planning expenses.

The name Kolandéla comes from the Lingala word which means tracking.

The idea came from a personal need to track my expenses. I think it is
important to know how to evaluate in order to improve ; and to evaluate
we need to h

ave the necessary data.
