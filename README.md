# Kolandéla

Kolandéla is an application for managing and planning expenses.

The name Kolandéla comes from the Lingala word which means tracking.

The idea came from a personal need to track my expenses.
I think it is important to know how to evaluate in order to improve ;
and to evaluate, we need to have the necessary data.
